Creating this project has been a great learning experience for me as a beginner. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of dynamic interactions, event handling, and DOM manipulation in Javascript.

Furthermore, creating this project also increased my understanding of how CSS is used in styling and ensuring interface responsiveness.
